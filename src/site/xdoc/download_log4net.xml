      <subsection name="Using a Mirror">
        <p>We recommend you use a mirror to download our release
        builds, but you <strong>must</strong> verify the integrity of
        the downloaded files using signatures downloaded from our main
        distribution directories. Recent releases (48 hours) may not
        yet be available from the mirrors.</p>

        <p>You are currently using <b>[preferred]</b>.  If you
        encounter a problem with this mirror, please select another
        mirror.  If all mirrors are failing, there are <i>backup</i>
        mirrors (at the end of the mirrors list) that should be
        available.

        <p>There are two different binary releases,
        <code>oldkey</code> and <code>newkey</code>.  Both contain
        assemblies built for most supported platforms and have been
        built from the same code base, they only differ in the strong
        name key used to sign the assemblies.</p>

        <p>See <a href="./release/faq.html#two-snks">the FAQ</a> for
        background.  We recommend you use the assemblies signed with
        the "new" key whenever possible.</p>

  <section name="Verify Releases">

    <p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
    files using the PGP signature or MD5 checksums.  The checksums are
    not as strong indicators as the PGP signature.</p>

    <p>Please read <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html">Verifying
    Apache HTTP Server Releases</a> for more information on why you
    should verify our releases.  The PGP keys used to sign our
    distributions are part of the <a

    file</a>.</p>
