    <!--  DYNAMIC DEBUG COMPILATION
          Set compilation debug="true" to enable ASPX debugging.  Otherwise, setting this value to
          false will improve runtime performance of this application. 
          Set compilation debug="true" to insert debugging symbols (.pdb information)
          into the compiled page. Because this creates a larger file that executes
          more slowly, you should set this value to true only when debugging and to
          false at all other times. For more information, refer to the documentation about
          debugging ASP .NET files.

          Set customError mode values to control the display of user-friendly

          "On" Always display custom (friendly) messages  
          "Off" Always display detailed ASP.NET error information.
          "RemoteOnly" Display custom (friendly) messages only to users not running 
          on the local Web server. This setting is recommended for security purposes, so 
          that you do not display application detail information to remote clients.

          Application-level tracing enables trace log output for every page within an application.

          trace information will be displayed at the bottom of each page.  Otherwise, you can view the 
          application trace log by browsing the "trace.axd" page from your web application
          root.

          To disable cookies, set sessionState cookieless="true".
